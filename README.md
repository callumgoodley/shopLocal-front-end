# shopLocal-front-end
front-end of our shopLocal project App

This is our shopLocal ios app which is intended to connect users with local independent shops dependent on their geo-location, it 
allows customers to select stores in their local area and make paypal purchases of their products.

It was built in Javascript using React-Native and a multitude of API's.



To run the app locally you will need to install Xcode and run "npm run ios" in your console.

If this is not working please run "npm install" in the console then cd into "ios" then run "pod install".
